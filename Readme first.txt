To run the aplication it's necessary to execute both proyects at the same time
because the one called WebApi is the proyect that the aplication uses to
access to the methods that make the program run well. And proyect called 
GameChallenge is the UI.  

1. Execute the  ChGameDB.sql to create the dataBase 
2. Run both solutions 


Important Note: I had a lot problems with the server that I used to storage my API
that's why I decided to send the challenge in this way.
